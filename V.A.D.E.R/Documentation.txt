V.A.D.E.R. is a collection of scripts (some new, some reused), and is intended to make things easier by 
consolidating scripts and frequent actions into one place. All logging from existing scripts has been preserved.

Please email bugs to DLetts@amctheatres.com. Suggestions for changes & additional functionality are welcome!

-05/09/2024: v1.2
